YOUNG ADVENTURER: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to "Press Start", a musical fundraiser where YOU can help your favourite video game characters gain more lives and play on. I'm your host, Young Adventurer With A Green Hat and Boomerang.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: And I'm Princess Pomegranate!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Sorry folks, Princess Peach was tied up this evening.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Ahem! All these heroes are out of rings and out of lives. But with your help tonight we can raise enough gold rings to allow us all to play on!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: You met the heroes, let's meet their helpers...
YOUNG ADVENTURER & PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Ladies and Gentlemen, the sidekicks!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Oh no...the villains!
SPIKEY TURTLE: Great to see you!
MARCO THE PLUMBER: Long time-a no see Spikey T! How're the kids-a?
SPIKEY TURTLE: Growing up so fast. Mrs. T has another litter on the way!
MARCO THE PLUMBER: No-a kidding!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Time to introduce these iconic characters you see on stage tonight, starting with...the heroes!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Thank you, thank you, thank you!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Ahem!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: And now, the villains!
LORENZO THE BROTHER: What-a about the sidekicks?!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Plus, tonight we have a special lifetime acheivement award for Pac Anne!
PAC ANNE: It's LADY Pac Anne!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: And now for the most important part. According to the ancient, sacred Konami Code, if we don't earn enough gold rings by the end of this show - all the characters you see will be stuck out-of-play - forever!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: So sit back, relax, and remember - our fate lies in your hands.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Tonight's show is broadcast throughout all the video game kingdoms, but we're especially excited about performing live, right here in Ajax.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Because our sources tell us that your kids play more video games than anyone else....anywhere! Parents, we thank you!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Tonight is all about giving, and to help explain how you can participate, let's welcome, Evil Robot!
EVIL ROBOT: To my left is the Ringometer 5000 - a machine I designed to take over the entire world! Muahahaha!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Evil Robot!
EVIL ROBOT: Just kidding. This machine tallies the rings that you donate. Our goal is 5,000 rings, because that's how many we need to earn enough lives for everyone.
PRINCESS: Have there been any rings donated so far?
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating...calculating...calculating...we have earned....(SFX).....535 rings...which is 10.7 percent of our goal.
PRINCESS: We're on our way!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Now we know what you may be thinking; how did we get all these famous video game characters together, in one room, for this special event?
PRINCESS: It all began one morning when the sidekick Little Mushroom went to check-in on her hero, Marco the Plumber...
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Hey, Marco! Marco, I know you're in there, I can hear you crunching. There you are! Hey, want to go take the cart around the racetrack today...what do you say?
MARCO: What's-a the point?! I've been out of play-a forever! Can you pass me that bottle of ketchup?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Here ya go...how many bottles of ketchup have you gone through? You gotta take it easy on that stuff!
MARCO: Who-a cares, I have no rings, I have no-a lives...there's nothing left...but ketchup!
LITTLE MUSHROOM: You know, just 'cause you're out of play doesn't mean you have to stay all cooped up in here.
MARCO: Cooped up? Koop-as?! Oh, how I miss-a the Koopas!
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Oh Marco, I hate seeing you this way.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Lorenzo the Brother, Paws the Fox! I just came from Marco's house - being out of play is really getting to him.
LORENZO: Potato chips and ketchup?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: How'd you know?
LORENZO: It's a-family thing.
PAWS THE FOX: It's not just Marco, Speedy too! He's broken three treadmills since being out of play. He's got way too much energy, and no where to use it!
K9: You guys talking about the heroes being out of play?
LITTLE MUSHROOM, LORENZO, PAWS: Uh huh.
K9: It's been ruuuff! MegaKid calls me every 5 minutes wanting to hang out. I mean, I'm a loyal companion, but that's a little much!
FAIRY GUIDE: If only they'd invested ten percent of their rings like I advised them to.
HELPFUL DINOSAUR: Well, we gotta do something. For their sake AND ours!
PAWS: What could we possibly do to help the heroes earn more rings?
K9: I know, we could have a bake sale!
ALL SIDEKICKS: Nahh.
FAIRY GUIDE: We could do a car wash.
ALL: Nahh.
LORENZO: Bingo night?
ALL: Nahh.
PAWS: It's gotta be something BIG, something GRAND, something...SHOW-Y.
HELPFUL DINOSAUR: That's it! We'll put on a show!
ALL: Yea!
HELPFUL DINOSAUR: We're going to need some help.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Yea, we can't do it alone we're only sidekicks.
FAIRY GUIDE: Let's ask the villains to join us! They're at their weekly book club right now!
SPIKEY TURTLE: ...But let me ask you this...did anyone else see the hat as a physical symbol of the cat's inner struggle?
ALL VILLAINS: Woooooah....
ALL SIDEKICKS: Villains!
K9: We need your help to put on a fundraiser, so we can get the heroes back in play!
MAD SCIENTIST: Back in play? But we're loving this extra free time!
FAIRY GUIDE: You're not anxious to get back into the game?
GENERIC GHOST: Are you kidding? We're villains, and chillin' is what we do best.
HELPFUL DINOSAUR: I don't think you understand how bad it is...
MARCO: I'm out-a ketchup! (sob) There's NO...MORE...KETCHUUUUUUP! (sob)
VILLAINS: We're in.
HELPFUL DINOSAUR: Great! Now we just gotta tell the heroes.
SLIMY ALIEN: I've got an idea...Hey look, free gold rings!
LORENZO: Heroes - we've-a come up with a plan to get you all back into play-a!
MEGAKID: Bingo night?
HELPFUL DINOSAUR: No, better! A musical fundraiser to raise gold rings!
SPEEDY: A show...and we'll be the stars?
ALL: Yes!
MEGAKID: We'll sing!
KARATE GUY: We'll dance!
MARCO: People will-a cheer and-a clap for u!
ALL: Yes!
JOHN ELWAY: This may just be the best idea we've ever had!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: And there you have it folks, the story of how all of this came together.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Alright, coming up next, we've got a special song that the heroes wrote themselves.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Plus, we introduce two very special guests. You won't wanna miss it!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: All that and more after a word from our sponsors.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Make up! I need some powder...I'm feeling a little shiny!
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Ah!! John Elway, you scared me! What are you doing here?
JOHN ELWAY: I thought I heard something...hey, what were you doing with your feet there?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Uh...um...nothing!
JOHN ELWAYL I may be an all-star MVP football player, but that doesn't mean I don't recognize a time-step when I hear one.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: I...I....
JOHN ELWAY: You've got some serious talent there Little M! Please tell me you're performing int he show later.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Just...just the sidekick number...
JOHN ELWAY: What?! With that talent you need a solo! Center stage! The audience will love it! Did you even ask for a slot?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: No way, I could never - I'm just an NPC.
JOHN ELWAY: A what?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: A 'Non-Playing Character.' You know, a sidekick. Nobody really cares about us.
JOHN ELWAY: Take a knee, kid. When you're facing 3rd and 10 in the fourth quarter down by two possessions it's no time to rely on the old playbook, ya gotta dig deep and go for the hail mary that could put ya back in this...you know what I'm saying?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: I'm not following...
JOHN ELWAY: Like a good friend told me, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Easy for you to say. You're a hero, you're a star. When you're raised a sidekick, things are a little different.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: And we'reback with "Press Start", the magical musical fundraiser that mooches your money away.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Tonight we're honoured to welcome two very special, suprise guests! Please put your hands together for Square Builder Eve and Angry Birdy!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: I still don't understand why they're here...
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Trust me, it's for good ratings! We couldn't be happier to have you, thanks for taking time away from your busy schedules.
SQUARE BUILDER EVE: I mean, I did have to move a couple of things around, but you're welcome.
ANGRY BIRDY: The traffic on Salem was terrible! But I'm here! And I'm smiling!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: So tell me, it's been so long, what's it like to have your game rank number one on the charts?
SQUARE BUILDER EVE: It's pretty great. This ends in 45 minutes right? 'Cause I just started building a second story on my house and I hear it's gonna rain soon...
ANGRY BIRDY: Yea, it's nice being on top...especially on top of a pig as I crash down from above!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Well, thanks for being here. We're looking forward to your commentary throughout the night. Let's move on with our show, shall we?!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Yes, please. Now ladies and gentlemen let's welcome, the reaon we're all here tonight, the heroes themselves!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Now I have to ask the tough question, that I'm sure is on eveyrone's mind...how did you all run out of lives?
SPEEDY: The truth is, staying alive is hard, hard work. Every time we're in play we're battling terrible obstacles.
MARCO: Molton lava!
KARATE GUY: Taekwondo masters!
JOHN ELWAY: The New England Patriots!
SPEEDY: But it's no big deal, we're well-oiled machines.
MEGAKID: Some of us, literally.
JOHN ELWAY: Yea, we've trained our whole lives for this stuff. Watch this...Marco, look out! Hammer brothers everywhere, giant bullets coming right at you, a lava pit up ahead!
MARCO: Dodge-a the hammers, jump on the bullet to launch over the lava! Wa-Hoo!!!
SPEEDY: Karate Guy! Two henchmen sneaking up behind you!
KARATE GUY: Back sweep, elbow down, round house kick - kee ya!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Elway! 4th down, you're being blitzed - no one's open!
JOHN ELWAY: Find the gap, run it up the middle, shovel pass to the tight end! Nailed it!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: That is simply amazing. You're all so brave, and so strong.
ALL HEROES: Why yes, we know.
MARCO: In fact, we wrote a song about that-a very thing.
PRINCESS: Well that was...breathtaking. Ok Evil Robot, let's check the Ringometer!
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating...till getting donations in from Cloud Canyon...buffering, buffering... the wifi is a little slow....OK, our new total is...(SFX)...1,472 rings!
PRINCESS: Wow, thank you everyone who has donated so far. You know, everyone is doing their part to help support our cause. Especially, Marco and Lorenzo's 2nd cousin twice removed, Giuseppe. He has been punching an unlimited coin block since the start of the broadcast, and will continue non-stop until the end of the show. Giuseppe, how are you doing over there?
GIUSEPPE: So far-a, so-a good-a! I'm-a just getting warmed up, hopefully I-a don't have to use the bathroom!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: That's the spirit Giuseppe! Keep up the fearless work! Ok, it's time for another commercial break, we'll be back with a suprising number from the villains, a word from our celebrity guests, and much more! Does anyone else notice this spotlight washing out my complexion?
JOHN ELWAY: Hey Little M, this is your chance. Go tell Young Advenurer about your act.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Young Adventurer, I was hoping...
MARCO: Little Mushroom! There-a you are! I need your help with the dance-a moves for the final number... is it-a step-a kick? Or a kick-a step?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Step, kick, step, kick, bend, up, and pose.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: That's it!
MARCO: Thank-a you. I can't-a wait to get back into play. I'm so tired of feeling like I don't-a matter anymore.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: I know the feeling.
MARCO: What?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Oh nothing! I'm sure we'll reach the goal - I believe in you!
MARCO: I believe in me too. Let's just hope-a things go exactly as they're planned...no suprises.
YOUNG ADVENTURERE: Little Mushroom, did you need something?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Um....no, not anymore.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Good, cause we're on in 3, 2, 1...
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Welcome back to "Press Start", the 80bit fundraiser that is sure to tickle your pixel.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Well it's time for our "getting to know you" segment. Please give a dark, dastardly welcome to...Spikey Turtle!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: So, Spikey Turtle, what was going through your very large but empty-spiked head when you decided to kidnap my cousin Peach and bring her to that damp, cold, dark tower?
SPIKEY TURTLE: Well, to be honest, it was a quiet Sunday. And I had always admired Marco and his brother, and that was the only way I could think to get them to come over for a Bar-b-q....
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Haven't you heard of a text message?!
SPIKEY TURTLE: I'm really sorry Pomegranate, but I treated your cousin well...nightly bedtime stories, turn-down service, homemade breakfast...my blueberry scones are to die for. Ask these guys.
SPIKEY TURTLE: You see Princess, sometimes people overlook the other side of us villains. Take Slimy Alien for example - did you realize she's a bird enthusiast?
SLIMY ALIEN: Guilty as charged.
SPIKEY TURTLE: And Evil Robot - she won the world badminton championship last spring.
EVIL ROBOT: I've got a really strong serve.
SPIKEY TURTLE: And Zombie....well...zombie....hm....
ZOMBIE: Rar raw raw raw....me like mushrooms!!!!!
SPIKEY TURTLE: Anyway....you can see, Princess, we're all jst abunch of regular guys and gals, looking to make an honest living.
ALL VILLAINS: Whew, time for lunch! Couldn't have come sooner!
GENERIC GHOST: Hey, what do you get today?
SPIKEY TURTLE: Let me look...baloney?! YES! Gotta love Mrs. T. Evil Robot?
EVIL ROBOT: Nuts and bolts again.
SLIMY ALIEN: I'll take that over my snail and squid salad!
ZOMBIE: Peanut butter and MUSHROOMS!!!!!
MAD SCIENTIST: Well, I've got pastrami on rye with heirloom tomatoes, seasonal greens, and a chipotle aioli.
ALL OTHERS: Wanna trade?
YOUNG ADVENTURER: You guys are the best! I tell ua, we have the best villains, don't we ladies and gentlemen? Let's give them another round of applause. Surely that number earned us some rings, Evil Robot - what's our latest tally?
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating, calculating...whoa, the community of Skull Island really enjoyed that one....our new total is...(SFX)....2,966 rings.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Wow, we've reached half of our goal! Remember the number to hit is 5,000. Rest assured, your donations tonight will not be wasted.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Let's check in with our celebrity commentators to see what they think of the show so far.
SQUARE BUILDER EVE: Well truthfully, it's hard for me to wrap my mind around that kind of 2-dimensional life. It's SO nostalgic...like...we get it, the 90's were awesome...but c'mon, move on.
ANGRY BIRDY: These guys are doing a great job! Unlike those PIGS! Geez! Those PIGS with their smug little smiles and wobbly bodies! Hey! Do I smell bacon??
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Yes, thanks for that very thoughtful feedback.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Coming up, the sidekicks perform a number that will be sure to leave you with smile! Plus, a special lifetime achievement award goes out to a very seasoned guest.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: All that and more after a word from our sponsors.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Wardrobe!
MEGAKID: Hey Little Mushroom, do you have the fundraiser script? I need to take a look at someting...
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Uh yea, I think I might have one in here somewhere.
MEGAKID: Let me take a look.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Wait! No!
MEGAKID: What are these?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Uh...nothing.
MEGAKID: Wow! These are fun! What do you call them?
LITTLE MUSHROOM: They're nothing...I gotta go! Give em back!
MARCO: What's-a going on out here?
JOHN ELWAY: Oh hey! Toadstool, you told them about your tap routine?! I knew you could do it. You guys gotta check out her time step, it's amazing...
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Uh...
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Tap routine?! Like, a dance solo? You can't be serious?!
KARATE GUY: A sidekick, dancing...alone in the spotlight?!
JOHN ELWAY: Yea, show them Little M!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Yea, show us Little M...
MEGAKID: Haha! Did you see that?!
KARATE GUY: That's why sidekicks are sidekicks...not heroes!
SPEEDY: A sidekick, with a solo act in the show...that'll be the day...
YOUNG ADVENTURER: We're back in 5, 4....run along Little Mushroom...your little sidekick song is up next...make sure your shoes are on tight!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Welcome back to "Press Start", a fantastic fundraiser to fund your fearless friends. Ladies and Gentleman, let's hear it for the characters who put the "Oh!" in "Loyal"...the sidekicks!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Well wasn't that lovely! Aren't they the cutest? Let's hear it one more time for all of the sidekicks!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Now folks, lets check back in with Giuseppe, the cousin nwho has been punching that unlimited coin block without any interruptions. Giuseppe!? How're you feeling?
GIUSEPPE: I could really use a power-up right about now-a!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Just hang in there, and remember, it's all for a good cause. Evil Robot, let's check the ringometer.
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating...calculating...our new total is...(SFX)...3,998 rings.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Well the night is still young folks! Pleas edonate...remember, the more you give, the longer we live.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: And now everyone, let's dim the lights, take a breath, and calm the mood for a special moment in our show...the presentation of the lifetime achievement award. To present this special honour, please help me welcome Speedy the Hedgehog and Slimy Alien.
SPEEDY: Only once a century does a character come along that breaks all boundaries and reinvents the hero!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Speedy! Slooooow it doooown.
SPEEDY: Only once a century does a character come along that breaks all boundaries and reinvents the hero!
SLIMY ALIEN: She's got an appetite like a hungry, hungry hippo and a heart that glows like a lite-brite. We couldn't be more proud to give our lifetime achievement award to...the one...the only...PAC ANNE!
PAC ANNE: Thank you? Lifetime achievement? I didn't think I was done achieveing things?! Why, just last week I got out of bed and made some toast - isn't that something? I tell ya I feel just as spry and young as the day I ate my first power pellet! Watch this...In fact...wait...no...not the music! No, I'm not done talking yet!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Thank you for those inspiring words. We've gotta take a quick break but when we return, the moment we've all been waiting for...the final number, and our grand total ring count will be revealed! You won't want to miss it. Wardrobe! The tear is getting BIGGER...
JOHN ELWAY: Putting yourself out there, taking a risk - no one ever said it was easy.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: What was I even thinking? I knew they would laugh at me. And what happened?
JOHN ELWAY: They laughed at you.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: They laughed at me! Me, Little Mushroom. I was just being myself. Why do they care if I have a single moment onstage?
JOHN ELWAY: Well, the thing most people don't realize about heroes is - sometimes we're just as scared as you.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Scared of what?
JOHN ELWAY: Of not being a hero anymore. Of being gone from the limelight. When you're a hero for so long, you get used to the feeling of being important.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: I guess the same is true for a sidekick, but like...the opposite.
MARCO: We're still a lot-a rings away from our goal - do you think we'll make it?
SPEEDY: I don't know....maybe we should just face reality - with all the touch scrreens, 3D grpahics, apps - no one really cares about us anymore.
MEGAKID: What are you saying Speedy?
KARATE GUY: He's saying maybe we're not in play because no one wants to play us.
SPEEDY: I just don't know how we got here - it's like one minute we're on top, and the next we're old news.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: And we're back folks, with our final act of the evening!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Square Builder Eve, Angry Birdy - what are your thoughts going into this last strech.
SQUARE BUILDER EVE: Riveted, truly riveted. I'm on the edge of my seat.
ANGRY BIRDY: As long as any PIGS don't show up and steal your rings, I think you just might make it! Wait?! Did I just hear an "oink"?!?
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Well folks, now's your last chance to get those final donations in. And to get you excited, we've got a final number that will power...you...up!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: A song and dance that conveys the grit, the excitement, all the emotions of being in the final strech of the game.
YOUNG ADVENTURER & PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Ladies and Gentlemen, put your hands together for, the final level!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Evil Robot, please give us the final tally!
SPEEDY: This is it!
MARCO: Mamma-mia - hold me!
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating...calculating...our final total is...
ALL: Oh no!! What happened?!? What do we do?!
PAC ANNE: Muahahahaha!
ALL: Pac Anne!?!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: She cut the feed! We've lost our entire broadcast!
KARATE GUY: We're doomed!
PAC ANNE: Muahahahaha! You thought you could just get rid of me with your playoff music, never to hear from me again? Well if you think my career is over, then it's over for ALL of us! If I can't play on...neither will any of you!
MEGAKID: Why?! Why would you do this?
PAC ANNE: Becoming a hero again isn't just about earning more gold rings! It takes more than that...
SPIKEY TURTLE: Generic Ghost, get her!
GENERIC GHOST: Woogoowoogoowoogoowoogoo!!
SPEEDY: Now we'll never get the rings we need to play on!
MEGAKID: And we're almost out of time!
MARCO: Does anyone have any ketchup?
SLIMY ALIEN: Wait! There must be some way we can earn more rings...without the broadcast.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Live audience of Ajax, you all have rings, don't you?!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: If you have a ring, make some noise and hold it up in the air! I can't hear you, make some noise!
EVIL ROBOT: That looks like enough rings to reach our goal.
SPEEDY: But we have to EARN the - and we have no more acts!
LITTLE MUSHROOM: I've got something. Elway, your cleats!
JOHN ELWAY: With pleasure!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: We've got nothing else to lose.
JOHN ELWAY: You can do it Little M.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Sidekicks, hurry, collect those rings!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Well, you saw it folks! The moment a hero was made.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: If you enjoyed that breath-taking number, please donate any rings you have in your possession! The heroes fate lies in your hands. Just pass your rings to the aisles!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Look at that - look at all those ring you've helped us earn.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: I'm just glad I could help.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Help? You stole the show!
JOHN ELWAY: I'm proud of you Little M, against all odds, you really came through.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Wait, are you crying?
JOHN ELWAY: Ahem, no. John Elway never cries. It must be sweat.
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Evil Robot, here they are - please give us the final tally.
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating, calculating...
MARCO: You know, even if we don't reach-a the goal, I know there are lots of-a different ways to be a hero now.
EVIL ROBOT: Calculating ring total....calculating...calculating...the final ring total is 4,999 rings! We need 1 more ring to play on!
ALL CAST: 1 more ring?! OH NOOOO!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: But we have only seconds left!
LORENZO: What about-a Giuseppe?
ALL CAST: Giuseppe!!!
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Giuseppe, are you there?!
LITTLE MUSHROOM: Giuseppe, listen to me. We need you to just punch that coin block one..more...time.
ALL: Whoo hoo! We did it!!
MAD SCIENTIST: I fixed the feed - we're broadcasting around the world again!
YOUNG ADVENTURER: Everyone who just joined us, listen to me. I want you to know we just reached our goal, and can all play on because of this amazing little fungi.
LITTLE MUSHROOM: You mean fun-girl?
PRINCESS POMEGRANATE: Yes. This fun-girl has showed us taht to be a hero you don't need rings, you don't need special powers, you need courage. And strength.
KARATE GUY: And tap shoes.
YOUNG ADVENTURER: TOday all of us WILL play on, but even if some day we run out of lives again, we know there are many ways we can still be a hero.
